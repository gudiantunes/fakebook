# "Simple" app with the funcionalities of a chat for testing React Topics

## Topics:
    > useEffect/useState
    > Custom hooks
    > React Router DOM (deprecated)
    > API calls

## How it works:
    You can send messages from onde client to another,
    create new accout, and see a list of random friends.

    The random friends are listd when you create your account,
    and they're never online nor answer your messages.
    
    All messages sent and accounts created area lost when 
    you close the app.
